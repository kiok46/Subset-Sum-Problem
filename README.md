# Subset-Sum-Problem
Solving the Subset Sum Problem using Python, Pandas and Numpy.

[Was playing around with Pandas, might help someone.]

### What is it about?

Well, If you have a set of devices working/running and consume a certain amount of power and now you want to reduce the load by a given percentage.
This will give you all the possible sets of running devices having total power consumption less than or equal to the new total power.
